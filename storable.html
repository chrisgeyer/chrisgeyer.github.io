          <p>Dude Solutions wanted to bring their maintenance work order tracking suite to the next level by utilizing predictive analytics. There was only one problem - they had no data to mine.</p>
          <p>As a member of the Dude Labs innovation team, we needed to quickly validate if creating a companion app to collect this data would be a viable business concept.</p>
          <p>We built the app from scratch in 6 months. I led all the design initiatives and collaborated with our clients to ultimately move our MVP towards a beta launch, including working on logo, marketing and pricing. I even learned some Android code to speed up making UI polish.</p>
          <p>Our team used different, radical UI techniques with map based tracking, optical character recognition and a conversational interface. This approach was rooted in serving a user base who were not very technically savvy (some just switched from using a flip phone in the last few years!) As a result, we relied on the basic smartphone concepts that they were actually familiar with like texting, using the GPS and taking a picture.</p>

            <h2>Daily Close</h2>
            <p>During our first week as a team, we locked ourselves in a meeting room and sketched out all of our conceptual ideas. Our goal was to determine what we could deliver as a first version within a week or two, so we often looked at three different levels for any new feature.</p>
            <p>We always started with the ideal version, which was just thinking blue sky. To determine what was possible, we would ask ourselves the question, "what's actually feasible with the technology we have" and that would help filter out some ideas. The third step is to pare the feasible down even further in what would be attainable the quickest in the time box we set.</p>
            <p>Once we had refined and narrowed our initial vision, we built a working app and immediately went to test the concepts viability onsite with a school. The school was having an engineering condition audit performed by one of the company’s partners, who we were targeting to use this app.</p>
            <p>After climbing up onto roofs to see where the HVAC units were and having some of the engineers test out the concept flow, we had found out 2 things:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The conversational flow showed promise in the ability to quickly handle gathering the minimum make, model and serial number. We had tested with some of the school’s staff and unprompted, they were able to complete the flow in only a few minutes.</li>
              <li>Our intended audience had to change as the engineering partners had developed their own forms and processes that they used to input the assets data due to their focus on reporting back on budget values, which were not a major concern for us at the time.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>myHub Cleanup</h2>
            <p>In order to facilitate further user research so we could move quickly, I established and built a client research program for our team. This involved partnering with different customer facing teams like Client Success, Sales & Help Content in order to get our message across different channels to find volunteers.</p>
            <p>By setting rules around which clients were off-limits due to deals being signed and other scenarios, I was able to curate small batches of potential clients to email and recruit. This involved testing out different subject lines and email content in order to find what was most relevant to getting people to sign up.</p>
            <p>Through A/B testing I increased the conversions and gathered a sizable list that I could reach out to at a moment's notice for things like surveys, usability testing and finding alpha testers.</p>

            <h2>Tenant SMS Conversations</h2>
            <p>Another thing we wanted to do was to improve upon the standard web form that was in the current product suite. Our goal was to have an experience where you did not have to type at all.</p>
            <p>So we chose to use optical character recognition for that you snap a picture of the name plate of any type of equipment and it would read in the text and then the conversational dude agent would ‘talk’ to you and let you know what he wanted to you to fill out so it would read all the text in how all these boxes on the on the picture and then you would actually just answer the questions with whatever info you needed and it copies it down.</p>
            <p>It's really accurate so people don't have to type in 16 digit serial numbers that they would often get wrong. We don't make anyone feel bad about being human since people make mistakes when trying to type those in and be accurate.</p>
            <p>Another thing that we learned was around the conversational language that we had to improve was the key text around the fact that the picture actually update live if you zoom in and zoom out. It was something that we were stuck on for a bit and we had to go through to really find the actual text that would make it intuitive in order to have users make sure they actually knew what they could do.</p>
            <p>That the text would update and you could get closer to a really small piece of text that you want to copy into the flow.</p>
