          <p>Storable was on a mission to take over the self storage sector with leading technology solutions. They bought the biggest software operations offering, Sitelink.</p>
          <p>As the first designer for a 20 year old windows application. I was tasked with migrating features to the web. I was able to simplify and add value to the future of storage operations.</p>

            <h2>Daily Close</h2>
            <p>myHub was a half baked web version that needed to get to feature parity in order for more clients to start using it full-time.</p>
            <p>The first feature we worked on moving over was for the daily accounting close process. The legacy windows screen was very overcomplicated and cluttered, so the goal was to create a simpler version to build.</p>
            <p>I went on-site with a storage operator to see how they completed their daily accounting and what problems they encountered with the existing options.</p>
            <p>I developed some simple concepts to just track the reported and counted types of charges, in order to show any discrepencies to investigate.</p>
            <p>I first tested a prototype with some support team members in order to see if the design had promise, which overall was positive.</p>
            <p>I then worked on learing React in order to develop a production level prototype which I validated with actual customers and was able to deliver to the engineering team so they could integrate this into the application.</p>

            <h2>myHub Cleanup</h2>
            <p>Taking over a web application that was built with no standards in mind by isolated developers and actually went out of its way to copy over windows paradigms, one of the first things I did was a complete site audit. This resulted in finding large discrepencies with things like 60 different shades over blue being used over a small amunt of pages.</p>
            <p>In order to keep myself busy and add value when the agile squad was putting out fires resulting from the buggy old windows codebase I worked through every page in the app cleaning up the page designs and code to be more standard and consistent across the site.</p>
            <p>This included updating style choices, making things to be cleaner and simpler as well as starting to add better UI patterns that was could utilize going forward.</p>

            <h2>Tenant SMS Conversations</h2>
            <p>A largely requested feature by customers was the ability to have two way texting with their renters straight inside the platform.</p>
            <p>Many of our customers were using third party solutions to achieve this but they were clunky and did not integrate with our software.</p>
            <p>Again I came up with a few concepts for direction and got some feedback and consensus from the product and design teams, where I then created prototypes to test with actual customers.</p>
            <p>This was a huge value add for Sitelink to have a prioritized, validated and simple solutiont to add to both versions of the platform.</p>
