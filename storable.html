          <h1 class="align-center">Storable / Sitelink</h1>
          <p>Storable was on a mission to take over the self storage sector with leading technology solutions. They bought the biggest software operations offering in Sitelink.</p>
          <p>As the first designer for a 20 year old windows application that was tasked with migrating features to the web, I was able to simplify and add value to the future of storage operations.</p>

            <h2>Daily Close</h2>
            <p>myHub was a half baked web version that needed to get to feature parity in order for more clients to start using it full-time.</p>
            <p>The first feature we worked on moving over was for the daily accounting close process. The legacy windows screen was very overcomplicated and cluttered, so the goal was to create a simpler version to build.</p>
            <p>I went on-site with a storage operator to see how they completed their daily accounting and what problems they encountered with the existing options.</p>
            <p>I developed some simple concepts to just track the reported and counted types of charges, in order to show any discrepencies to investigate.</p>
            <p>I first tested a prototype with some support team members in order to see if the design had promise, which overall was positive.</p>
            <p>I then worked on learing React in order to develop a production level prototype which I validated with actual customers and was able to deliver to the engineering team so they could integrate this into the application.</p>

            <h2>myHub Cleanup</h2>
            <p>Taking over a web application that was built with no standards in mind by isolated developers and actually went out of its way to copy over windows paradigms, one of the first things I did was a complete site audit. This resulted in finding large discrepencies with things like 60 different shades over blue being used over a small amunt of pages.</p>
            <p>In order to keep myself busy and add value when the agile squad was putting out fires resulting from the buggy old windows codebase I worked through every page in the app cleaning up the page designs and code to be more standard and consistent across the site.</p>
            <p>This included updating style choices, making things to be cleaner and simpler as well as starting to add better UI patterns that was could utilize going forward.</p>

            <h2>Tenant SMS Conversations</h2>
            <p>Another thing we wanted to do was to improve upon the standard web form that was in the current product suite. Our goal was to have an experience where you did not have to type at all.</p>
            <p>So we chose to use optical character recognition for that you snap a picture of the name plate of any type of equipment and it would read in the text and then the conversational dude agent would ‘talk’ to you and let you know what he wanted to you to fill out so it would read all the text in how all these boxes on the on the picture and then you would actually just answer the questions with whatever info you needed and it copies it down.</p>
            <p>It's really accurate so people don't have to type in 16 digit serial numbers that they would often get wrong. We don't make anyone feel bad about being human since people make mistakes when trying to type those in and be accurate.</p>
            <p>Another thing that we learned was around the conversational language that we had to improve was the key text around the fact that the picture actually update live if you zoom in and zoom out. It was something that we were stuck on for a bit and we had to go through to really find the actual text that would make it intuitive in order to have users make sure they actually knew what they could do.</p>
            <p>That the text would update and you could get closer to a really small piece of text that you want to copy into the flow.</p>
