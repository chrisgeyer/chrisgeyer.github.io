          <h3>Velox Case Study</h3>
          <p>Dude Solutions wanted to bring their maintenance work order tracking suite to the next level by utilizing predictive analytics. The only problem was that they had no data to mine.</p>
          <p>As a member of the Dude Labs innovation team, we wanted to quickly validate if creating a companion app to collect this data would be a viable business concept.</p>
          <p>We built this app from scratch in 6 months. I led all the design initiatives and collaborated with our clients to ultimately move our MVP towards a beta launch, including working on coding, logo & marketing & pricing.</p>
          <p>Our team used different, radical UI techniques with map based tracking, optical character recognition and a conversational interface. This approach was rooted in serving a user base who were not very technically savvy (some just switched from using a flip phone in the last few years!) As a result, we relied on the basic concepts that they were familiar with from using smartphones because they did know how to text, use the GPS and take a picture.</p>

        <h1>Steps / Key Learnings</h1>
        <div class="feature">
          <div>
            <h2>Pivot after field test with version 1</h2>
            <p>For the first week together as a team, we locked ourselves in a meeting room and sketched out all the different ideas we had around the concept. In order to facilitate what a first version of something could deliver in a week or two would be, we often looked at 3 for levels of a feature.</p>
            <p>So we started with the ideal version which is blue sky. To determine what could work we would ask the question of what's actually feasible with the technology we have and that would help filter complexity out. That left us to take that and really focus on what would be attainable the quickest in the time period we had.</p>
            <p>After we had determined the smallest attainable version of our initial vision, we built that and went to test the concepts viability onsite with a school. They were having an engineering condition audit done by one of the company’s partners, who we were targeting to use this app.</p>
            <p>After climbing up onto roofs to see where the HVAC units were and having some of the engineers test out the concept flow, we had found out 2 things:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The conversational flow had promise in the ability to quickly handle gathering the minimum make, model and serial number. We had tested with some of the school’s staff and unprompted they were able to complete the flow in under a few minutes.</li>
              <li>Our intended audience had to change as the engineering partners had developed their own forms and processes that they used to input the assets data due to their focus on reporting back on budget values, which were not a major concern for us at the time.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Client Research Program</h2>
            <p>In order to quickly be able to facilitate further user research so we could move fast, I built up a client research program for our team. This involved partnering with different customer facing teams like Client Success, Sales & Help content in order to get our message out there across different channels to find volunteers.</p>
            <p>By setting rules around which clients were off limits due to deals being signed and other scenarios I was able to curate small batches of potential clients to email and recruit. This involved testing out different subject lines and email content in order to find what was most relevant to getting people to sign up.</p>
            <p>Through A/B testing I increased the conversions and gathered a sizable list I could reach out to at a moments notice for things like surveys, usability testing and finding alpha testers.</p>

            <h2>Conversational Interface</h2>
            <p>Another thing we wanted to do was to improve upon the standard web form that was in the current product suite. Our goal was to have an experience where you did not have to type at all.</p>
            <p>So we chose to use optical character recognition for that you snap a picture of the name plate of any type of equipment and it would read in the text and then the conversational dude agent would ‘talk’ to you and let you know what he wanted to you to fill out so it would read all the text in how all these boxes on the on the picture and then you would actually just answer the questions with whatever info you needed and it copies it down.</p>
            <p>It's really accurate so people don't have to type in 16 digit serial numbers that they would often get wrong. We don't make anyone feel bad about being human since people make mistakes when trying to type those in and be accurate.</p>
            <p>Another thing that we learned was around the conversational language that we had to improve was the key text around the fact that the picture actually update live if you zoom in and zoom out. It was something that we were stuck on for a bit and we had to go through to really find the actual text that would make it intuitive in order to have users make sure they actually knew what they could do.</p>
            <p>That the text would update and you could get closer to a really small piece of text that you want to copy into the flow.</p>

            <h2>Floorplans and Dropping Pins</h2>
            <p>Once we had our main flow to add assets built, we needed to expand the feature set of the app. This included the ability to track points of interest of equipment inside buildings. This concept had promise but after testing we found a few areas for improvement around the first step of being able to precisely pinpoint where the equipment was located.</p>
            <strong>Accurate pin locations</strong>
            <p>During testing we got a lot of feedback that users were expecting to be able to drop the pins location by tapping their finger on the screen. However I had a hypothesis that this might not be the most accurate method. We devised a simple test that had multiple methods of setting the pins location on an html canvas app that calculated accuracy of the coordinates. We did a lot of internal testing with staff around the office to gather test data. Once the data came back we found that tapping your finger was not accurate because your finger was over top the pin and it was harder to see. We then change our input method for this to be the opposite of keeping the pin in a fixed position and moving the background polygon around. This produced much more accurate results and ensured users could quickly get the asset location in the precise spot they wanted.</p>
            <strong>Building Orientation</strong>
            <p>Once we had a clear method to put assets locations on the map, we also noticed that users were having trouble orienting themselves inside of a building. The most common thing I observed when people would use it was that they literally would pause and look up around the room when they had to figure out where they were inside a building. It was hard for them to determine directionally what corner or area they already were in. We knew that just a blank polygon of the building shape was not giving enough context for them to figure it out. A quick idea we had was to add the ability to transpose a floor plan onto of the polygon to give more context. This was much more attainable then going down a CAD drawing based path. We utilized the camera features we had already built out to allow the captured photo to be manipulated onto of the building polygon. Once we tested this with users, it was easily validated that this helped someone find Room 123 when they could have a drawing to look at.</p>

            <h2>Flexible data attributes backed by Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>The main goal was that we wanted technicians to capture first was just make/model/serial # which was pretty straightforward for them but we added a significant taxonomy system that was backed by a Machine learning algorithm so we recommend based on the asset categories.
It would display additional attributes that they could enter and this would learn based off of the organization itself if everyone always want to track one type of information on a type of equipment or across the whole cloud of user base for the company where if these things are vastly different across the board because it represents such a big spectrum of types of equipment. For instance a HVAC unit has things like CFM and filter size to know how much air is pushing but a motor has things like amperage and RPMs and those are totally different. We didn't want to have really long list of choices so we wanted to recommend is based on the types of assets they selected. The algorithm would present them with a list of things that could track in addition to standard ones like just taking a picture of the unit itself, or scanning a barcode that they want to track, or condition tracking to say this is a new unit or this is something that's been around for 20 years and we know it's going to be on its last legs. An example for that would be something like a fire extinguisher you can track the chemical type and some of those are different and it knows the previous chemical entered and can pre fill in some of the answers based off of most common ones, again to limit the the typing experience on the whole.</p>
