          <p>OpenNMS is a 20 year old open source project that was acquired last year and investing for growth.</p>
          <p>As the first designer for network monitoring platform built by developers for developers, it needed to level up to achieve growth targets. I started the process to guide their solutuion to a cloud model while simplifying the UI.</p>
          <p>I facilitated a workshop with senior leadership in order to get on the same page for what a "cloud" vision would look like and started to iterate our way there.</p>

            <h2>Setup &amp; Onboarding</h2>
            <p>Migrating from an on-premise solution, we needed a way to create an instance, since users would not be able to run install scripts locally anymore.</p>
            <p>I worked on putting some simple steps together to highlight the important aspects for a network admin to get setup.</p>
            <p>This included being able to remove a lot of manual steps that were currently taken since we would be able to automate alot of things behind the scenes, resulting in a much more efficient time savings, which was part of the future value proposition.</p>

            <p>In order to keep myself busy and add value when the agile squad was putting out fires resulting from the buggy old windows codebase I worked through every page in the app cleaning up the page designs and code to be more standard and consistent across the site.</p>
            <p>This included updating style choices, making things to be cleaner and simpler as well as starting to add better UI patterns that was could utilize going forward.</p>
