          <p>OpenNMS is a 20 year old open source project that was acquired last year and investing for growth.</p>
          <p>As the first designer for network monitoring platform built by developers for developers, it needed to level up to achieve growth targets. I started the process to guide their solutuion to a cloud model while simplifying the UI.</p>

            <h2>MVP Prototype</h2>
            <p>Taking over a web application that was built with no standards in mind by isolated developers and actually went out of its way to copy over windows paradigms, one of the first things I did was a complete site audit. This resulted in finding large discrepencies with things like 60 different shades over blue being used over a small amunt of pages.</p>
            <p>In order to keep myself busy and add value when the agile squad was putting out fires resulting from the buggy old windows codebase I worked through every page in the app cleaning up the page designs and code to be more standard and consistent across the site.</p>
            <p>This included updating style choices, making things to be cleaner and simpler as well as starting to add better UI patterns that was could utilize going forward.</p>
